Hello, my name is Gerald (Jerry) White and I'm a advanced MS Statistics student at UChicago.

My thesis research area is denoising autoencoder architectures in self-supervised learning, specifically in the context of vision.

I'm currently interested in vision and NLP machine learning applications.
